Changes since previous release:
- Hinting for the lowercase l (U+006C) has been fixed in HP Simplified Bold. This was causing the glyph to render tightly spaced under certain conditions.
- Value for strikethrough position in the font metadata has been updated to be centered on the x-height.
- PANOSE value for the Proportion has been changed from Condensed to Even Width to allow the font to be substituted more likely with Arial than Arial Narrow.
